# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Exploring Temple University

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a GameBoy-ish game that will simulate Temple University's Campus and allow users to learn the campus. Dorms, Halls, and Centers will all be included in the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The main screen of the game will display an overhead view of the user's character. The user will be able to travel down streets and explore where everything is on TU's campus. Each building with be properly labled and provide a brief description of the structure. We have worked a lot with the turtle module- I plan to use that as the main function to allow the character to move with the user's input. I plan to outsource the sprites for the main character, the image for the builds and street. I plan to include everything within a 2-3 block radius starting from the SERC building. To simplify the inputs for the user, he/she will only be able to move up, down, left, and right. Each directional input will move the user a fixed distance.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I plan to at least have the map of campus uniquely designed by myself and the ability to explore it. I may not be able to include every single structure on campus, therefore my expectation is to stick to a 2-3 block radius starting from SERC. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of my project would include the inside of every building to allow the users to explore campus even further. In an ideal world, I would like to design a seperate map for the inside of each structure, but due to time constraints I may only do the inside of 1-2 buildings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of my project would include every single one of Temple's Halls, Dorms, and Centers, along with the inside of those buildings mapped out. It would provide detailed information about the resources provided from each building. Ideally, I would like to add interactable NPCs around the map of campus to provide quests or missions that require the user to explore the area even futher and interact with other NPCs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

What I will research first is to learn how to load the areas of the map as the user travels in the given direction instead of loading in the map all at once. My biggest inspiration for how the game should look and run is the 1st generation of the Pokemon games. It is an open world map and allow the user to explore freely. Next, I will need to import open source sprites for the main character and environment (buildings and roads). I will also have to research the exact location of various buildings on campus to make sure the map of the game is accurate. I will be using the turtle function to direct the character with the user's movement.
